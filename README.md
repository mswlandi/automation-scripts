# automation-scripts
Collection of (currently just one) python scripts to do some automation. Some of these are made for personal and easy use, so sometimes no input interface is provided, just some hard-coded strings, so be aware of that.

## vestibular_ufrgs.py
In the night of UFRGS' 2019 vestibular (college entrance exam) list of names came out, I thought of making this simple script to automate the process of looking through the list to find the names of my friends. Every year this big list is published, and it's common for the site to get down because of the great number of visitors, so this script makes it much faster to do the search.

To use, place the names in the 'nomes' list, and the script will search for them in the UFRGS' vestibular (college entrance exam) list of names, and output the names of those that it found, and for each of those that it didn't find, a list with all the names with the same first name, for you to manually search. URL substitution may be necessary.
